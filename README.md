#  bifurgra - Bifurcated InstaGram Media Viewer

IOS, maybe catalyst later

### Motivation

When I look at my nice new iPhone 11 photos in the IG app, they look horrible

This app fixes that. Its just for me for now

bifurcates separates portrait and landscape (and square streams) for optimal viewing of each
